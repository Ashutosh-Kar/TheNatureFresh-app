## 💡 Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

The idea behind this app was to enable users to implement the functionality of placing and tracking orders from the android app itself.
 

## ⛓️ Dependencies / Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>

-The app depends upon the firebase sdk to make order requests and fetch products and track orders.

## 🚀 Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

In a future update, we will include admin dashboard to enable the host/owner to manage orders on the go.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

Download the app as per your needs from the release section and install it on your Android device.

Create a new account on the first login screen and then you can place orders and track them.

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

- The interface of the app is fairly simple, you just have to tap on + button for the products you want to add to cart on the main screen and then after finalising the order you can checkout using the cart icon on the top left.

- Orders can be tracked from the hamburger menu on the top left.

## ❗ Issues
